# CNN for Skin Cancer Detection Prototype

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for image classification. They utilize convolutional layers to detect patterns and spatial relationships and identify important features within them.

**Model**: 
In -> [[Conv2D->relu]*2 -> MaxPool2D -> Dropout]*2 -> Flatten -> Dense -> Dropout -> Out

**Test Dataset (Unseen Data) Accuracy**: 75%
