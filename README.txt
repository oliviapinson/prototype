# CNN for Skin Cancer Detection Prototype Proof of Concept

[See .ipynb file for outputs]

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for image classification. They utilize convolutional layers to detect patterns and spatial relationships and identify important features within them.

**Model**: 
In -> [[Conv2D->relu]*2 -> MaxPool2D -> Dropout]*2 -> Flatten -> Dense -> Dropout -> Out

**Test Dataset (Unseen Data) Accuracy**: 75%
